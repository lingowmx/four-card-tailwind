## My process
i thought will be an easier excercise doing it with react and tailwind, but then i realized i never worked by my self with some react tools. Also working with grid in tailwind was a little bit confusing on the beggining. At the end it was an interesting and fun project to do.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Working with grid. Basically that was what took more time. Also working with a layout and start passing props from component to parent elements
